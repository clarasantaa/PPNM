We tested the dependence of the convergence tests for the shooting method on: rmax, rmin, acc, eps. From the generated plots, we observe that:
	rmin has the most significant impact on the solution. When it is too large, the wavefunction deviates
	rmax also affects but not as much. When rmax increases, wavefunction is closer to the exact solution
	eps shows very little effects when changing it
	acc shows no visible effect on the result
